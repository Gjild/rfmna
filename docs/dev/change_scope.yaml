  "notes": "P2-02 hardening touches frozen-id mapped paths for RF extraction/conversion behavior, fail sentinel surfaces, and run CLI payload wiring while preserving run exit semantics. Frozen artifact #10 (canonical API data shapes/ordering) was explicitly assessed as non-impacted because no canonical API shape/order contract files were changed (`src/rfmna/sweep_engine/types.py`, `src/rfmna/viz_io/rf_export.py`, `src/rfmna/viz_io/manifest.py`). Governance evidence provided per Phase 2 policy."
